      already_confirmed: '''''''FIXME:'''''' Patchwork message, not suitable for all
        languages. Please use complete sentence with a placeholder to position correctly
        the missing part (not always at start of message).'
      confirmation_period_expired: '''''''FIXME:'''''' Patchwork message, not suitable
        for all languages. Please use complete sentence with a placeholder to position
        correctly the missing part (not always at start of message). The correct grammatical
        gender of "a new one" cannot be determined to translate it with the correct
        pronoun (e.g. in French: "un nouveau" for the masculine, "une nouvelle" for
        the feminine) and the same applies to "confirmed" (e.g. in French: "confirmé"
        for the masculine, "confirmée" for the feminine), as both are depending on
        what is meant in the missing leading part.'
      expired: '''''''FIXME:'''''' Patchwork message, not suitable for all languages.
        Please use complete sentence with a placeholder to position correctly the
        missing part (not always at start of message). The correct grammatical gender
        of "a new one" cannot be determined to translate it with the correct pronoun
        (e.g. in French: "un nouveau" for the masculine, "une nouvelle" for the feminine).
        The same may apply to the translation of "has expired" (it may use a passive
        form requiring agreement in some languages with the gender of the missing
        part implied but omitted at start of the English message).'
