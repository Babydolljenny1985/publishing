# Autogenerated Text Specification

This document specifies, in pseudocode, the autogenerated text shown on taxon overview pages (e.g., [https://eol.org/pages/311544](https://eol.org/pages/311544)).

Sentences are appended in the order presented.

Let *t* be a taxon on EOL, *a1* be the closest ancestor of *t* with a landmark value of ‘minimal’, and *f* be the family that *t* belongs to. *a1* and *f* may be null.

```
if t is a family:
	"t is a family of a1."
else if t is a genus:
	if f:
		"t is a genus of a1 in the family f."
	else:
		"t is a genus of a1."
else if t is a species:
	Species sentence with growth habit component, if present. There are many possibilities here; one is "t is a lichenous species of a1 in the family f." 
	
	if t is extinct:
		"This species is extinct."
	else if t has conservation status records:
		"It is listed as <status 1> by <provider 1>, ... , and <status n> by <provider n>."
	if t has marine environment records and t does not have terrestrial environment records:
		"It is found in marine habitat."
	else if t has freshwater environment records
		"It is associated with freshwater habitat."
	if t has biogeographic realm records:
		"It is found in <unique values of records>."

if t has landmark children:
	"t includes groups like <landmark children, limited to 3>."

if t has plant description traits:
	Plant description sentence, e.g. "It has <leaf trait values> leaves, <flower trait value> flowers, and <fruit trait value>."

if t has flower visitor traits:
	"Flowers are visited by <flower visitor trait values>."

if t is a species:
	if t has behavior traits:
		Behavioral sentence, e.g., "It is a solitary, nocturnal carnivore."
	
if t has lifespan traits:
	"Individuals are known to live for <first trait value> <first trait units>."
