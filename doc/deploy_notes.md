= MESSAGES TO A FUTURE SELF

== Explanation

...Please include here any information you might want a developer to know, when
they upgrade and deploy the code. Examples include notes about migrations that
are required, scripts that need to be run after the update, suggestions about
features to double-check once they are in production, or even reminders to ping
a specific developer or manager once the code is updated.

Messages that have been acted upon will be removed from this document (they will
persist in git histories, of course).

Thanks.

== THE NOTES:
